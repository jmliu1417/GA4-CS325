    This file contains the template for Assignment4.  For testing it, I will place it
    in a different directory, call the function <can_turn_off_lights>,
    and check its output. So, you can add/remove  whatever you want to/from this file.  But,
    don't change the name of the file or the name/signature of the following function.

    Also, I will use <python3> to run this code.
